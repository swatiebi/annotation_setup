# annotation setup

Automated setup and starting of an Anno or Genebuild annotation.


## quick start

start Anno annotation
```
bash anno_setup.sh <assembly accession>
```

start Genebuild annotation
```
bash genebuild_setup.sh <assembly accession>
```


## ENSCODE setup

The `enscode_setup.sh` script creates a centralized `enscode` directory and populates it with all code repositories required by the Anno and Genebuild annotation pipelines and subsequent datachecks.
